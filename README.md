# process-wrapper

ðŸŒ¯ Run binaries from node, with easy stdout/stderr manipulation + signal passthrough + exit code propagation.

Useful for building wrappers that affect the behaviour of CLI programs, for example by changing their output format.

## Usage

```ts
import spawnWrapped from 'process-wrapper';

// All arguments and signals are automatically are passed through.
// If the spawned command exits, this process will too with the same status code.
// 'line' is a line printed to an output stream. It includes the line terminator at the end.
spawnWrapped("some-cli", {
  mapStdout: (line) => "my stdout: " + line,
  mapStderr: (line) => "my stderr: " + line,
});
```
